# Contact Me

You can get in touch with me by opening the nearest window and yelling out of it real loud.

## Or you can wave to me

Just click this button to simulate a friendly wave.

<Wave />

Please note that I may not wave back. This is because I am verry far away and probably didn't see
you click this button.
